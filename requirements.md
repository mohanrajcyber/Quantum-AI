# Quantum AI - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
**Quantum AI** is an innovative multi-provider AI orchestration platform designed specifically for India's diverse population. Our platform revolutionizes AI accessibility by providing seamless access to 650+ AI models through a unified interface, addressing critical challenges in education, healthcare, retail, and rural development across Bharat.

### Vision Statement
To democratize artificial intelligence for every Indian, regardless of language, location, or economic background, by creating the most accessible, affordable, and culturally-sensitive AI platform in the world.

## Problem Statement
India faces a critical AI accessibility crisis that threatens to leave 1.4 billion people behind in the global AI revolution:

- **Linguistic Barriers**: 78% of Indians prefer regional languages, but 95% of AI services only support English
- **Economic Constraints**: Premium AI services cost ₹2,000-5,000/month, beyond reach of 80% of Indian users
- **Technical Complexity**: Current AI platforms require advanced technical knowledge, excluding 90% of potential users
- **Infrastructure Challenges**: 60% of India still relies on 2G/3G networks, incompatible with heavy AI applications
- **Cultural Disconnect**: Existing AI systems lack understanding of Indian contexts, festivals, traditions, and social structures
- **Educational Gap**: Limited AI literacy programs leave students and educators without essential 21st-century skills

### The Opportunity
With India's digital population expected to reach 900 million by 2025, there's an unprecedented opportunity to democratize AI access and create inclusive technological growth that benefits every citizen.
