- Rural AI Detailed Flow (with Fairness Algorithm)
- Master Control Dashboard Flow
- Circuit Breaker Trigger Flow
- Key Principles

## How to Use

These diagrams are in Markdown format with ASCII art for easy viewing in any text editor or IDE.

To convert to visual diagrams:
1. Use tools like Mermaid, PlantUML, or Draw.io
2. Copy the flow structure and recreate visually
3. Export as PNG/SVG for presentations

## Key Concepts

### AI Proposes. Humans Decide.
All high-risk outputs require human approval through Master Control.

### No Private Chat Monitoring
User conversations are encrypted and never accessed by humans.

### Bounded Ethical AI
Rural AI fairness algorithm enforcement, bias monitoring, and circuit breaker protection.

### Master Control Authority
Single governance point - all AI modules route through Quantum Master Core.
